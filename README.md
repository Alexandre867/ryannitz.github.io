#Current sites:

### https://ryannitz.github.io/

**[personal]** My main homepage that contains personal projects/resume/logs/overviews/etc.

### https://ryannitz.github.io/gallery.html

**[personal]** A site where I can preserve images and documentation regarding personal collections and travel interests. Highly dynamic site which now only requires an item to be added into a json file when a new image, gallery, or category is added. This site could interface beautifully with a database with relatively no changes required.

### https://ryannitz.github.io/wine.html

**[personal]** This site was created as an endpoint of a barcode that I printed on wine labels. Any time a friend or receiver of my wine would scan the code, they would be brought to this bad boy.

### https://ryannitz.github.io/create_alert.html

**[tool]** This site is used to interact with a js alert tool that I have used in many web projects.

### https://ryannitz.github.io/text_unscramble.html

**[tool]** This site is used to interact with a js unscramble tool that I needed for my main homepage. It is meant to 'roughly' simulate text unscrambling as seen in hollywood hacking scenes.

### https://ryannitz.github.io/mersenne.html

**[project]** This site was created for a number theory course as a final project. The grammar is not very good (oops). I'm decently proud of the overall layout and design. The calculators and modals could have been refined more.

### https://ryannitz.github.io/sleep.html

**[project]** This site was created for a health psychology course as a final project. This site was exceptionally fun due to the extensive use of highcharts with unique graphs and data.
